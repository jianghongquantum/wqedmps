    Parameters
    ----------
    delta_t : float
        Time step used for time propagation.

    tmax : float
        Maximum simulation time.

    d_sys_total : np.ndarray
        Array describing the local physical dimensions of the system bins.
        Each index is associated with the size of a tensor space.

    d_t_total : np.ndarray
        Array with dimensions for the time bins.
        Each index is associated with the size of a tensor space.
        In the case of a two directional light channel will be a list of two values.

    bond_max : int
        Maximum MPS bond dimension (chi) to use for truncation.

    gamma_l, gamma_r : float
        Coupling (decay) rates to the left and right channels respectively.
        (may be removed from this class in future versions)

    gamma_l2, gamma_r2 : float, default: 0
        Optional second set of coupling rates (e.g. for a second TLS).
        Default 0 means only one system.
        (may be removed from this class in future versions)

    tau: float, default: 0
        Delay time if modelling non-Markovian dynamics.

    phase : float, defulat: 0
        Relative delayed phase.
        (may be removed from this class in future versions)

    d_t : int
        Total size of the photonic tensor space.
        This is the product of the sizes of the indvidual tensor spaces.
